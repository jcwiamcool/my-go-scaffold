My Golang development scaffold, an API framework based on modular design using Gin, encapsulating common functionalities.

- `rate` interface limiting
- email notification when panic exception occurs
- cross-origin resource sharing (`CORS`) in interfaces
- recording `Prometheus` metrics
- generating `Swagger` API documentation
- `tracing` internal project links
- performance profiling with `pprof`
- unified error code definition with `errno`
- log collection with `zap`
- configuration file parsing with `viper`
- the `gorm` database component
- the `go-redis` component
- `RESTful API` response value specification
- code generators that generate data table CURD, controller methods, etc.
- `cron` scheduled tasks, configurable in the background interface
- real-time communication with `websockets`, demonstrated in the background interface
